selection on "click"

7 x 6 = 42 slots

select column --> piece goes to lowest free slot

after piece dropped --> check victory condition, show msg on win --> possibility to restart

1. HTML/CSS
- individual slot
	* square elem with circular elem in it
	* a class on slot indicates the player who has claimed the spot and styles the circle accordingly
- board as whole 
	* by column: 7 elem containing 6 slots (easiest to define which column was selected by user!)
	* by row: 6 elem containing 7 slots
	* all 42 slots in a single element (grid layout)

2. Javascript
- keep track of current player
- column selection
	* determine which slot in the column to put current players slot 
	* backwards loop
- check for victory
	* vertically
	* horizontally
	* diagonally
	* only check for current player
- show victory message (impossible to play during msg, possible to restart
- switch players
